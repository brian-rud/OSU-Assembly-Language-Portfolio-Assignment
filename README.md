# OSU-Assembly-Language-Portfolio-Assignment
This is the portfolio assignment for CS271 (Computer Architecture and Assembly Language) taken during the Spring Term 2020 through Oregon State University.

This program contains implementations of low-level I/O procedures in x86 assembly language.

The program prompts users for numeric input, validates user input, converts input to signed integers, performs calculations, and outputs results of the calculations to the console.

Writing this program was interesting because it taught me how simple things that I took for granted before (like getting user input) are implemented under the hood.
